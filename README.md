## 🚚 Future-Proof Fleet Management: Data-Driven Safety & Efficiency

### 📌 Project Overview

In the world of transportation, safety and efficiency are paramount. This project leverages data analytics to enhance fleet safety, identify high-risk drivers, and optimize truck selection. By analyzing incident patterns and fuel efficiency, we deliver actionable insights for a safer, smarter fleet.

### ⚠ Problem Statement

Fleet managers constantly battle safety risks, including speeding, lane departures, and unsafe following distances. Our goal is to:

- ✅ Identify high-risk drivers based on incident history.
- ✅ Recommend targeted safety interventions.
- ✅ Optimize truck selection for better fuel efficiency and lower risk.

### 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Processing & Transformation** – Cleaned and structured fleet data to uncover key safety insights.
2. **Risk Assessment** – Classified drivers based on incident frequency and severity.
3. **Truck Optimization** – Analyzed fuel efficiency and incident data to recommend optimal truck models.
4. **Visualization** – Created dashboards to visualize risk profiles and efficiency metrics.

### 📁 Repository Structure

- `Data/` – Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `Visualizations/` – Includes dashboards and charts for data representation.
- `Assigning Risk.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook detailing the risk assessment process.
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation.

### 📊 Key Insights

- Identified top 10% of drivers responsible for 60% of incidents.
- Recommended specific training modules for high-risk drivers.
- Suggested replacement of older truck models with newer, fuel-efficient ones.

### 🚀 Conclusion

By harnessing the power of big data analytics, fleet managers can proactively address safety concerns and make informed decisions to enhance operational efficiency.
